[A]
One day, I will
Have it all
No fear, mind clear
I am standing tall
But for now I’m
Folded like a parasol
Bracing my stomach for the cannonball

[B]
Am I acting strange?
I swear I’m not trying to scare you
Guess it goes without saying 
That I am not yours to handle
Amygdala reigns (dissociate) 
I feel like I’m starting to panic
Oh my, oh no
I feel like I’m starting to panic

[A]
Sit down, lay back
Calm yourself
Deep breaths, just rest
Almost over now
Hope they, don’t see
Me crawling out the bathroom stall
Only place I could sneak some alcohol 

[B]
Am I acting strange?
I swear I’m not trying to scare you
Guess it goes without saying 
That I am not yours to handle
Amygdala reigns (dissociate) 
I feel like I’m starting to panic
Oh my, oh no
I feel like I’m starting to panic

[C]
Oh I... 
I think I’m starting to Panic…
