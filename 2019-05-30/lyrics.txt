[Verse 1]
		   Am            Em            Dm         Em
why am I so fucking dumb, when i'm not even happy
Am                 Bdim   Dm                   Em
Chemicals fly, anhedonia. Laughing alone. Pathetic. 
		   Am          Em       Dm         Em
In my dream, you killed me, bleach and ammonia
      Am                       Bdim          Dm                   
But I end up in some sick purgatory, where I have to relive all the

[Pre-Chrous]
Bdmin
Mistakes I make cause I feel
Dm
Medicate or hit me
Bdim                   E
Manic, world sick, apathetic


[Chorus 1]
Dm     
  Head trauma, head trauma
C 
  Head trauma, I gotta head trauma 
Bdmin                 Am
  I wanna, be no one


[Verse 2]
nocturnal soiree, halfway thoughts
at the end of the day out of my body, and at the end of it all it's not me
would it kill you, will it kill me. Abuse these thoughts               
repetition has its own kind of pleasure, where I get to relive all these

[Pre-Chrous]
Mistakes I make cause I am
Celebrate or kiss me
Manic, world sick, apathetic

[Chorus 2]
Dm     
  Head trauma, head trauma
C 
  Head trauma, I gotta head trauma 
Bdmin                 Am
  I wanna, be no one
Dm    
  Head trauma, head trauma
C 
  Head trauma, I gotta head trauma 
Em
  Take these pills before for the trigger
