Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
It may be your last.
Next year we may all be living in the past.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Pop that champagne cork.
Next year we may all be living in New York.

No good times like when we were kids
Had no loans to big to shore
Tight-knit friends who were dear to us.
Will be near to us no more.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
The water's getting higher
Next year we may all be living in the fire

No good times like when we were kids
Had no jobs to quit or chores 
Tight-knit friends who drink beer with us
Will be near to us no more.

But at least we all will be together.
If covid allows.
From now on, we'll have to muddle through somehow.

So have yourself a merry little   Christmas now.
