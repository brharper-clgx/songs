Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
It may be your last.
Next year we may all be living in the past.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Pop that champagne cork.
Next year we may all be living in New York.

No good times like the olden days.
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who were dear to us.
Will be near to us no more.

But at least we all will be together.
If the Lord allows.
From now on, we'll have to muddle through somehow.

So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.
