[Verse]
There's light in your eyes
Have you heard the prophecy?
Don't believe their lies
Before was a dream

All the world's a stage
For the Traveling Symphony
You only get what you take
So take what you need

[Chorus]
Welcome to the
Undersea
Young and hostile
Erase history

I am too much
In the sun
Silent starship
Station 11

[Verse] 
We don't go off the wheel
some went out their to cut their teeth
Out past the minefield                
There's nothing to grieve

Don't have to tell me twice
To be loved's a calamity
I'm no good at goodbyes
Errant debris

[Chorus]
Welcome to the
Undersea
Young and hostile
Erase history

I am too much
In the sun
Silent starship
Station 11

[Part II]

[Verse]
To the 
monsters we're the monsters
It's all fucked
And goes by in a blur

[Chorus]
Over the garden wall
Follow the wolves               | Into the woods                  
Poor Captain Lonegan
All alone again

[Verse]
I don't 
want to live the wrong life
One shot 
Better get it right

[Chorus]
Over the garden wall
Into the woods
Poor Captain Lonegan
All alone again
