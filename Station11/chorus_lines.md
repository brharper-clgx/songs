Welcome to the
Undersea
Young and hostile
Heed the prophecy

Am I too much
In the sun?
Silent starship
Station 11
========================================================================================================================================

I am too much
In the sun
Silent starship | The path things take | Death on the stage | We'll all be dead
Station 11

I am no good
At goodbyes
Silent starship
suspended in the nigh

Red bandanas
Teeth are white
I can see the
Explosions in your eyes

Welcome to the
Undersea
Young and hostile
Fight the bourgeoisie

========================================================================================================================================

(4)
Share with a friend
The eyes are wrong
striking matches
Setting fire
It's a strange day
out of my head
Assembly lines
Young and hostile
Head full of bees
Wait your whole life
Death on the stage
You run her down
step towards the ledge
One more coffee
Stuck together
To dream of home
If you won't laugh
The path things take
We'll all be dead
Can you feel it
Red bandana
Lift the mattress 

(3) 
bloody war
Eyes are wrong
to your house
laugh out loud
Down a hill
Walls were gone
Cheeks turn red
Tangled hair
Claw foot tubs
play favorites
waste your life
sell your shirt
squawking birds
take a drag
You're on fire
off the floor

(5)
Get out of my head
No sound in my head
Solitude is bliss
Don't have to tell me twice
Everyone in bed
I forget who I am
Remember what you love
Station 11
