[Verse]
This is not the boy who
Cried wolf, there is no before
To the wolves, we are the monsters
There's mines on the golf course

I will come and find you
Once I find my way back to the start
Keep it close, the knife in your pocket
And steel your racing heart

[Chorus]
Welcome to the
Undersea
Young and hostile
Heed the prophecy

am I too much
In the sun?
Silent starship
Station 11

[Verse] 
Run into the fire
Let's pretend it it like the Before
You ought to see the travelling symphony 
You'll find them at the fork

I remember damage
Silent starship suspended in nigh
These are beacons for the prophet
They look like fireflies

[Chorus]
Welcome to the
Undersea
Young and hostile
Heed the prophecy

am I too much
In the sun?
Silent starship
Station 11
