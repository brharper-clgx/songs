Over the garden wall
Follow the wolves       | Into the woods
Poor Captain Lonegan
All alone again

==============================================================================================================

(6)
Poor Captain Lonegan
fasten your safety belt
Adrift in a strangers world
She's running into the fire

(5)
serving the food
(The) world is on fire
Something I read
Behind her smile
(the) moment begins
solitude

(7)
All alone again
It is a bloody war
Think it was something I read
Adrift in a stranger's world
Just for an hour or two

(3)
The before

==============================================================================================================
That one may smile and be a villain
Captain Lonegan
serving the food
I don’t want to live the wrong life and then die
It was something that I’d read
Why do I feel so out of place?
At my good friend's house
Run into the fire
Behind every smile
The before
Adrift in a stranger’s galaxy
when it came to gettin' right in the head
fasten your safety belt
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
And the moment begins
It’s a bloody war
Cheeks turn red
The mile to my house
Passed through my fingertips
I smell the engine grease
squawking birds
Walls were gone
Got blow in his nose 
To the monsters, we're the monsters.
Tangled hair
minefield
Need to get through
I forget who I am
I cram it down my throat
You don't need to sell your shirt
A limited edition
sucked the life out of you
How honest do you want me to be?
striking matches
I told him you weren't an asshole, you were just an artist
Circle the wagons
I didn't even get to have the dream
Head full of bees
The road's open
handling the money
like I'm a ghost
It's a strange day
step towards the ledge
I feel your racing heart
like a ghost
We went to a party
The only regret I have is caring
I'm no good at goodbyes
Solitude is bliss
Share with a friend
Is this like the before?
There's no reason to get hurt
I don’t like revealing secrets
Lift the mattress off the floor
Dr. Eleven
Red bandana
Assembly lines
You run her down
The path things take
Do I hear scratching at the window
Must be hard not knowing what you want to be
I fell asleep inside my car
the Traveling Symphony
To be loved is a calamity
Severn City Airport
The wolves think you're scary like you think they're scary
There’s light beneath your eyes
Claw foot tubs
Death on the stage
guess it works  as advertised
Spend all day in bed
I hope you’re really not dead
There were monsters in your closet
Fought myself in circles
It’s a nightmare
beacons for the Prophet
Setting fire to your house
Avoid contact with anyone
To dream of home
I wish I could stay here forever
no need to ask directions
now accepting callers
never split the troupe, never go off-wheel
They look like fireflies
No sound in my head
I remember damage
the first generation to be rid from the trauma
I am a little explosion
The Museum of Civilization
They fall from your mouth
Silent, my starship suspended in nigh
Living off the wheel
ends justify the means
Just the first one who stood up
Maybe real, or imagined
Everyone in bed
Never try to write an oral history of the world after it ends
The world is still full of garbage from before
The survivors are the problem
The world’s a dangerous fucking place
My head is spinning
stomachaches 
Don’t have to tell me twice
It’s hard to see dangerous people
If you won’t laugh
I’ll live inside your head
on our neighbor's lawn
You’re on fire 
We went out for dinner
It all came crashing down
cigarette is burning
Trying not to laugh out loud
Democracy's a joke
Been meaning to look for meaning
They told me I wasn’t anything
There’s someone inside me, and I don’t like strangers
Can you feel it
Stuck together
now what the hell do you do
And all the world's a stage
Take a bite of this apple
you do like you do
The cult came here last fall
I can’t help but play favorites
standing out in the road
Don’t have to tell me twice
The day is over but you’re not tired
To float away with you 
Got stains on his t-shirt
Wait your whole life
The eyes are wrong
I’ve fallen out of love with me
Know it by heart
I was a walking disaster
If what they say is true
One more coffee
where thick moss grows
Pre pans
We don't go off-wheel (we don't leave the wheel)
One day I'll be wondering how
Listen to many, speak to a few
I think I'll go home and mull this over
Is this happening?
There's no before
no need to waste your life
the post-pans were special
only the liars survive
The sky is the limit
Survival is insufficient
Gotta get up to get down
No, take something to sleep through it
I try not to worry
Spinning on the wheel
I was a walking disaster
Eyes as white as clouds
Get out of my head
stares back at me 
Our revels are now ended. "Yea, all which it inherit... Shall dissolve. "We are such stuff as dreams are made on, a little life rounded with a sleep.
the winds of chaos
Take a drink, take a drag
I’m sick of me too
if I try to feel at all
Young and hostile
mines on a golf course
Let's pretend
I don't want to grow old and die, but I'm glad I get to do it with you
It’s dangerous to be on your own
But I'm safe now. I found it again.... My home
Kick open the doors and windows
This street is haunted
This is not the boy who cries wolf; this is the wolf
Sleepwalker
Head full of alcohol
With a vice in his hand
I swim but I don't get wet 
The night I split in two
