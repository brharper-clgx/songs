There's light in your eyes
Have you heard the prophecy?
Don't believe their lies
Before was a dream

All the world's a stage
For the Traveling Symphony
You only get what you take
So take what you need



We don't go off the wheel
The (whole) world has been under seige 
Out past the minefields
There's nothing to grieve

Don't have to tell me twice
To be loved's a calamity
I'm no good at goodbyes
The Before's debris

========================================================================================================================================
like a ghost
And all the world's a stage
Adrift in a stranger’s galaxy
The path things take
To the monsters, we're the monsters.
The before
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
the Traveling Symphony
Is this like the before?
That one may smile and be a villain
It’s hard to see dangerous people
Sleepwalker
We don't go off-wheel (we don't leave the wheel)
Spinning on the wheel
the first generation to be rid from the trauma
Run into the fire
Survival is insufficient
Never try to write an oral history of the world after it ends
The road's open
The world is still full of garbage from before
Pre pans
This is not the boy who cries wolf; this is the wolf
But I'm safe now. I found it again.... My home
To be loved is a calamity
The world’s a dangerous fucking place
There's no before
I remember damage
I'm no good at goodbyes
Death on the stage
minefield
beacons for the Prophet
Silent, my starship suspended in nigh
Our revels are now ended. "Yea, all which it inherit... Shall dissolve. "We are such stuff as dreams are made on, a little life rounded with a sleep.
The wolves think you're scary like you think they're scary
Dr. Eleven
Must be hard not knowing what you want to be
stares back at me 
The survivors are the problem
like I'm a ghost
the post-pans were special
never split the troupe, never go off-wheel
I told him you weren't an asshole, you were just an artist
Listen to many, speak to a few
Red bandana
Avoid contact with anyone
Is this happening?
The cult came here last fall
only the liars survive
The Museum of Civilization
Know it by heart
I was a walking disaster
I didn't even get to have the dream
I don’t want to live the wrong life and then die
They look like fireflies
Don’t have to tell me twice
mines on a golf course
Living off the wheel
Kick open the doors and windows
the winds of chaos
Just the first one who stood up
Circle the wagons
Severn City Airport
Captain Lonegan
==============================================================================================================
Do I hear scratching at the window
How honest do you want me to be?
The path things take
I cram it down my throat
Why do I feel so out of place?
The mile to my house
My head is spinning
the winds of chaos
I didn't even get to have the dream
You run her down
If you won’t laugh
The only regret I have is caring
Survival is insufficient
Cheeks turn red
But I'm safe now. I found it again.... My home
Living off the wheel
minefield
Head full of bees
Red bandana
No sound in my head
It’s a bloody war
It was something that I’d read
I am a little explosion
Run into the fire
Never try to write an oral history of the world after it ends
The sky is the limit
I forget who I am
never split the troupe, never go off-wheel
the Traveling Symphony
The day is over but you’re not tired
the first generation to be rid from the trauma
now accepting callers
striking matches
There's no before
if I try to feel at all
I don't want to grow old and die, but I'm glad I get to do it with you
To float away with you 
no need to waste your life
I wish I could stay here forever
Everyone in bed
Spend all day in bed
standing out in the road
Don’t have to tell me twice
the post-pans were special
Claw foot tubs
Setting fire to your house
guess it works  as advertised
Take a drink, take a drag
I don’t want to live the wrong life and then die
when it came to gettin' right in the head
There's no reason to get hurt
At my good friend's house
To dream of home
I’m sick of me too
Silent, my starship suspended in nigh
squawking birds
Let's pretend
sucked the life out of you
Trying not to laugh out loud
The eyes are wrong
I was a walking disaster
It's a strange day
I can’t help but play favorites
You’re on fire 
I was a walking disaster
now what the hell do you do
Eyes as white as clouds
Behind every smile
Sleepwalker
To the monsters, we're the monsters.
Kick open the doors and windows
I think I'll go home and mull this over
A limited edition
The survivors are the problem
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
There’s light beneath your eyes
Just the first one who stood up
Dr. Eleven
Death on the stage
Spinning on the wheel
Pre pans
like a ghost
you do like you do
Avoid contact with anyone
cigarette is burning
The world is still full of garbage from before
ends justify the means
Got blow in his nose 
I hope you’re really not dead
Fought myself in circles
The before
Been meaning to look for meaning
mines on a golf course
Got stains on his t-shirt
I’ll live inside your head
They told me I wasn’t anything
Know it by heart
I smell the engine grease
And the moment begins
on our neighbor's lawn
beacons for the Prophet
They look like fireflies
You don't need to sell your shirt
Walls were gone
Young and hostile
Share with a friend
To be loved is a calamity
only the liars survive
Take a bite of this apple
Tangled hair
Is this happening?
I fell asleep inside my car
I feel your racing heart
It all came crashing down
The road's open
Wait your whole life
It’s dangerous to be on your own
The wolves think you're scary like you think they're scary
This is not the boy who cries wolf; this is the wolf
Stuck together
serving the food
where thick moss grows
And all the world's a stage
Captain Lonegan
like I'm a ghost
I remember damage
Assembly lines
I'm no good at goodbyes
Gotta get up to get down
handling the money
no need to ask directions
Head full of alcohol
It’s hard to see dangerous people
With a vice in his hand
Must be hard not knowing what you want to be
Is this like the before?
I don’t like revealing secrets
I try not to worry
Solitude is bliss
That one may smile and be a villain
The Museum of Civilization
Severn City Airport
They fall from your mouth
Maybe real, or imagined
Adrift in a stranger’s galaxy
One more coffee
There’s someone inside me, and I don’t like strangers
We don't go off-wheel (we don't leave the wheel)
Passed through my fingertips
Democracy's a joke
If what they say is true
I’ve fallen out of love with me
Get out of my head
Can you feel it
Listen to many, speak to a few
We went out for dinner
stomachaches 
fasten your safety belt
stares back at me 
Circle the wagons
The world’s a dangerous fucking place
Don’t have to tell me twice
One day I'll be wondering how
No, take something to sleep through it
It’s a nightmare
step towards the ledge
Our revels are now ended. "Yea, all which it inherit... Shall dissolve. "We are such stuff as dreams are made on, a little life rounded with a sleep.
We went to a party
This street is haunted
The cult came here last fall
Lift the mattress off the floor
There were monsters in your closet
Need to get through
I told him you weren't an asshole, you were just an artist
