I feel your racing heart
They look like fireflies
We never go off wheel
no need to waste your life
what the hell do you do
Don’t have to tell me twice
The cult came here last fall
beacons for the Prophet
I remember damage
Is this like the before?
Adrift in a stranger's (1)

    As I dream
    One may smile
    Down a hill
    Let's pretend
    Squawking birds
    Wind's of chaos
    like a ghost
    The before
    (6)
    a knife in her pocket
    Circle the wagons
    The winds of chaos
    I'm no good at goodbyes

Survival, it is insufficient

I feel your racing heart
They look like fireflies
We never go off wheel
no need to waste your life
what the hell do you do
Don’t have to tell me twice
The cult came here last fall
And all the world's a stage
Is this like the before?
The path that things must take

========================================================================================================================================
This is not the boy who
Cried wolf, and there's no before
To the wolves, we are the monsters
There's mines on the golf course

I will come and find you
Once I find my way back to the start
Keep it close, the knife in your pocket
And steel your racing heart

Run into the fire
Let's pretend it it like the Before
You ought to see the travelling symphony 
You'll find them at the fork

I remember damage
Silent starship suspended in nigh
These are beacons for the prophet
They look like fireflies



Adrift in a stranger's land
Is it all just another disguise
Survival, it is insufficient
Don’t have to tell me twice

Run into the fire
Let's pretend it it like the Before
You ought to see the travelling symphony 
You'll find them at the fork

Beacons for the Prophet
I told him you weren't an asshole,
You were just an artist
And now you're just a ghost
========================================================================================================================================
like a ghost
And all the world's a stage
Adrift in a stranger’s galaxy
The path things take
To the monsters, we're the monsters.
The before
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
the Traveling Symphony
Is this like the before?
That one may smile and be a villain
It’s hard to see dangerous people
Sleepwalker
We don't go off-wheel (we don't leave the wheel)
Spinning on the wheel
the first generation to be rid from the trauma
Run into the fire
Survival is insufficient
Never try to write an oral history of the world after it ends
The road's open
The world is still full of garbage from before
Pre pans
This is not the boy who cries wolf; this is the wolf
But I'm safe now. I found it again.... My home
To be loved is a calamity
The world’s a dangerous fucking place
There's no before
I remember damage
I'm no good at goodbyes
Death on the stage
minefield
beacons for the Prophet
Silent, my starship suspended in nigh
Our revels are now ended. "Yea, all which it inherit... Shall dissolve. "We are such stuff as dreams are made on, a little life rounded with a sleep.
The wolves think you're scary like you think they're scary
Dr. Eleven
Must be hard not knowing what you want to be
stares back at me 
The survivors are the problem
like I'm a ghost
the post-pans were special
never split the troupe, never go off-wheel
I told him you weren't an asshole, you were just an artist
Listen to many, speak to a few
Red bandana
Avoid contact with anyone
Is this happening?
The cult came here last fall
only the liars survive
The Museum of Civilization
Know it by heart
I was a walking disaster
I didn't even get to have the dream
I don’t want to live the wrong life and then die
They look like fireflies
Don’t have to tell me twice
mines on a golf course
Living off the wheel
Kick open the doors and windows
the winds of chaos
Just the first one who stood up
Circle the wagons
