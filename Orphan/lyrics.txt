[Verse 1]
Hey little orphan, it's been a while
I guess that's my fault
Writing this letter, though you're not far
Guess I'm scared to talk

Yea...

I came Sunday morning to pick you up
And found you fast asleep
Your arms were around an old worn photograph
Tangled hair across your cheek

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanted to so bad to wake you up
But you looked so sweet

[Chorus]
You are the same as me
Looking for Shangri-La
Oh no
You have the same disease
An inner coup d'etat
Oh no

[Verse 2]
Remember the night you had me stop the car
Climbed on the hood and didnt' speak
We sat for an hour and watch the cars go by
Predented I didn't hear you weeping

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanted so bad to lift you up (cheer?)
But I felt so weak

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And the papers read
It's a tragedy
For a young family
The driver didn't see
No one ever dreamed
Such a thing
Could happen in our little town
There was no one else around

[Verse 3]
Today I woke up and found the words to say
Knocked on your door
Nobody answered, and the neighbors say
You won't be around anymore
