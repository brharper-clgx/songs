[Verse 1]
		   Am            Em            Dm         Em
why am I so fucking dumb, when i'm not even happy
Am                 Bdim   Dm                   Em
Chemicals fly, anhedonia. Laughing alone. Pathetic. 
		   Am          Em       Dm         Em
In my dream, you killed me, bleach and ammonia
      Am                       Bdim          Dm                   
But I end up in some sick purgatory, where I have to relive all the


Have I made a mistake


[Pre-Chrous]
Bdmin
Mistakes I make cause I feel
Dm
Medicate or hit me
Bdim                   E
Manic, world sick, apathetic


[Chorus 1]
Dm     
  Head trauma, head trauma
C 
  Head trauma, I gotta head trauma 
Bdmin                 Am
  I wanna, be no one


[Verse 2]
nocturnal soiree, halfway thoughts
at the end of the day out of my body, and at the end of it all it's not me
would it kill you, will it kill me. Abuse these thoughts               
repetition has its own kind of pleasure, where I get to relive all these

[Pre-Chrous]
Mistakes I make cause I am
Celebrate or kiss me
Manic, world sick, apathetic

[Chorus 2]
Dm     
  Head trauma, head trauma
C 
  Head trauma, I gotta head trauma 
Bdmin                 Am
  I wanna, be no one
Dm    
  Head trauma, head trauma
C 
  Head trauma, I gotta head trauma 
Em
  Take these pills before for the trigger

[Verse]
It is now or never
Proved that I'm not clever
I'm a fool, but I meant well, and anyway
The time for pleas was yesterday

Take me I surrender
Have no fight, did I ever?
Ridicule got me nowhere, an essay
Where I'll re-analyize all the

[Pre-Chrous]
Mistakes I make cause I feel
Medicate or hit me
Manic, world sick, apathetic

[Chorus 1]
Head drama, head drama
Head drama, I gotta head drama 
I wanna, be no one

[Verse 2]
Should I care to be happy
When the world's so fucking crappy
At the end of the day out of my body
At the end of it all it's not me

...

[Pre-Chrous]
Mistakes I make cause I am
Celebrate or kiss me
Manic, world sick, apathetic

[Chorus]
Head drama, head drama
Head drama, I gotta head drama 
I wanna, be no one
Head drama, head drama
Head drama, I gotta head drama 
Take these pills before for the trigger






[Alt Chorus]
Of all the things that I wish
I could still undo
I never re-alized that
I'm not over you
You always promised me that
We would get through


Of all the things that I wish
I could still undo
I never believed that I'd
Have to release you


Take these pills before the trigger
