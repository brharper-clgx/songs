[Verse]
My Susuwatari
Are you on the mend?
Slow blink in the morning
Scratch your sleepy head
…yea

[Chorus]
That dark night
Were you afraid?
That dark night

[Verse]
Smile for your family
Smile for your friends
Fake it like  you mean it
Come get out of bed
…yea

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Pacing through the lobby
Talking to myself
Can't quite parse my meaning
Clearly I need help
