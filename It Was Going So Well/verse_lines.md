Front door
Leave it here at your front door
wrapped in the sheets
Leave it
Striking matches
I'm a dumb mammal
you do like you do
I'm no good
You run her down

I'm no
You make me feel paranoid
all of your friends
Sundae
all of your friends
ok, if you're sure
Run into the fire
Claw foot tubs
sandwiched between

Lately
I've been feeling on the bend
Did I dream that
I was
Still a young kid?
In our neighbor's yard
Little cruel remarks
Holding hands
The sun's going

Lately
I've been feeling like underbid | I've missed | so dismissed
Did I dream that
I was
Still a young kid?
In our neighbor's yard
Little cruel remarks
Steel your heart
Young alchemist

(7.)
You make me feel paranoid
Trying not to laugh aloud
Leave it here at your front door
There's no reason to get hurt
She was a make believer
Gotta get up to get down
no need to ask directions
Life is better when you're home

(4.)
To dream of home
Speak to a few
Striking matches
We smashed it all
A paper cup
Assembly lines
Share with a friend
Beggars and thieves
One more coffee
(2|4) Book a one way ticket
(2|4) Sucked the life out of you
(2|4) Melting like a sundae
(2|4) Melting like a sundea
(2|4) I'm no good at goodbyes
(2|4) I'm no good at goodbyes
(2|4) Talk in backward riddles
like I'm a ghost
(2|4) Life goes on through the pain
(2|4) Life goes on through the pain
(2|4) I try not to worry

(5.)
Don't see eye to eye
Solitude is bliss
Keep you out to sea
Never fall apart
Float away with you
The only regret / I have is caring
You should run with me
This street is haunted
The day is over
But you're not tired
We don't choose to come / into existence
Boneless in the dirt
Writing on  the wall
My head is spinning


(3.)
claw foot tub
you're on fire
spend all day
lay in bed
galaxy
what the hell
I'm no good
run with me
smashed it all
starry night
shoot 'em up
morning star
I'm blushing
I'm a ghost
life goes on
