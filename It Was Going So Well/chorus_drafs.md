(9) It's just a chemical reaction
(8) It's just the creatures in my mind
(4) It's just that I haven't 
(4) been sleeping
(4) that well and
(5) I'm not quite alive

(9) It's just a chemical reaction
(8) It's the electric wilderness
(4) Out on the street
(4) You feel the heat
(4)
(5) 

(9) It's just a chemical reaction
(8) It's the electric wilderness
(4) It's buisiness
(4) It's gasoline
(4) Magazines
(5) Endless anxieties

(9) It's just a chemical reaction
(8) It's always feeling axious
(4) It's all the jokes
(4) And buttered toast
(4) 
(5) And fuck with the stars

(9) It's just a chemical reaction
(8) It's just a nightmare after dark
(4) 
(4) 
(4)
(5) 


(9) It's just a chemical reaction
(8) It's the electric wilderness
(4) It's just that I
(4) haven't been sleeping
(4) That well and I'm
(5) Not quite alive
