It's just a chemical reaction
It's just an endless wilderness
It's in your head
A tape cassette
On rewind
Take me to
The sublime

It's just a chemical reaction
It's just an endless wilderness
It's in your head
A tape cassette
On rewind
Everything
I have said

It's just a chemical reaction
It's the electric wilderness
It's buisiness
It's gasoline
Magazines
Endless anxiety

It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the fear inside your heart
I fell asleep, 
in the front seat
of your new car
All feathered and tarred

It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the creatures in my mind
It's just that I haven't 
been sleeping
that well and
I'm not quite alive

It's just a chemical reaction
It's the electric wilderness
It's buisiness
It's gasoline
Magazines
Endless anxiety

Can we just hold on for a minute?
It's just another false reaction
It's just a limited edition
Do you hear scratching at the window
I can't but help in playing favorites
No, don't take something to sleep through it

It's setting fire to your house
It's lying bonelss in the dirt
Then it won't be obvious
It's just you want the obvious
Hold me in the palm of your hand
Take something to sleep throo-ough it
I look out only for my self
I fell asleep inside my car
It fits in the palm of your hand

(9)
I fell asleep inside of my car
It is a limited edition
Day's end, now what the hell do you do?
I am a little big explosion
It's hard to see dangerous people

A nightmare
I try not
To worry
I promise
Explosion
