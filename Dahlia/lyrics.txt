The darkness of loneliness cannot be fought directly

Back to a cold bed
The ransom note she left
The quietus of the end of the night
You lay with two open eyes
Replaying the reels and writhe
With guilt between the sheets
A drink will help outsleep death

I wanna lose my mind and all my thoughts
I want to slip into a world you’re not
I want escape from all the baggage
Oh

On the very first day
I embezzled two flowers
A dahlia and you
And you’re ghost
Is worn as a winter’s coat
It covers my naked throat
And all the enemies try and destroy me
Let them 

I wanna lose my mind and all my thoughts
I want to slip into a world you’re not
I want escape from all the baggage
Oh

Baby, there’s something I need to tell you
And I think it might cause you some pain
Maybe this was never meant to happen
Oh I feel, the icy water in my veins 

I wanna lose my mind and all my thoughts
I want to slip into a world you’re not
I want escape from all the baggage
Oh
