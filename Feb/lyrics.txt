[Verse 1]
Lately
I've been feeling underbid
Did I dream that
I was
Still a young kid?
In our neighbor's yard
Little cruel remarks
Steel your heart
Young alchemist

[Chorus]
It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the fear inside your heart
I fell asleep, in the 
front seat of
your new car
the leather is marked | All feathered and tarred

==========================================================

[Verse 1]
I know
Something in my head's not right
Did I dream that
I was
Still a young tyke?
In our neighbor's yard  
Little cruel remarks
Steel your heart
Young acolyte

[Chorus]
It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the creatures in my mind
It's just that I haven't 
been sleeping
that well and
I'm not quite alive

[Verse 2]
Sunday
Stoned in some run down motel // run down | worn out | fatigued
one more coffee
It was
Going so well
Found your postcard
When things fell apart
Anyway
It's a strange day

[Chorus]
It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the creatures in my mind
It's just that I haven't 
been sleeping
that well and
I'm not quite alive



It's just the creatures in my mind 
| It's just what keeps me up at night
| Don't know where I'll end up tonight
| I don't want to grow old and die
| It's just a fading sunrise
| 

Stoned in some run down motel
| Stoned I ride the carousel
