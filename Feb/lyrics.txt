[Verse 1]
I know
Something in my head's not right
Did I dream that
I was
Still a young child?
In our neighbor's yard  
Little cruel remarks
Steel your heart
And you'll be fine

[Chorus]
It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the creatures in my mind
It's just that I haven't 
been sleeping
that well and
I'm not quite alive

[Verse 2]
Sunday
Stoned in some run down motel
one more coffee
It was
Going so well
Found your postcard
When things fell apart
Anyway
It's a strange day

[Chorus]
It's just a chemical reaction
It's just the creatures in my mind
It's just that I haven't 
been sleeping
that well and
I'm not quite alive
